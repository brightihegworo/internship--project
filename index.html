    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <p>
      <b>jasmine rice</b> - <u>jasmine rice</u> is the most traditional rice to use in coconut rice and adds the best flavor. You can easily substitute it with other types of white rice that you have on hand such as Basmati rice. Note that the
        <br>
        texture could be <s>slightly different</s>, but the taste will be on point.
    </p>
    <p>
       <i>coconut milk</i> - I used one can of full-fat coconut milk. You can substitute it with a can of light coconut milk instead, but note the rice will not be as rich (but still delicious!).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>sugar</em> - a pinch of sugar helps to balance out the flavor of the coconut milk. You can add more or less to taste.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>salt</strong>
