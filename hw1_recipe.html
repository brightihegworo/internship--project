    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    Place rice in the rice cooker. Add the water, coconut milk, salt, and shredded coconut. Stir well; use a plastic or wooden utensil to avoid scraping off the nonstick surface. Cover and set to cook.</li>
    <li>Once your rice cooker switches to "warm" mode, allow another 8 to 10 minutes for the rice to finish steaming. This will ensure your coconut rice is fully cooked and pleasantly sticky.</li>
    <li>Gently fluff with chopsticks before serving. Some of the shredded coconut may have risen to the surface; just stir it back into the rice. Taste it for salt, adding a little more if needed.</li>
